# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  

Audience Group	Why It Matters
Local policymakers	Identify inequitable commute burdens and design better transit, zoning, or housing policies
Transportation planners	Understand worker types most negatively affected by distance, mode, or lack of options
Employers designing remote/hybrid policies	See how commute time influences well-being, retention, and time equity
Community members/workers	Recognize how commute time affects energy, family time, and life satisfaction

Interview Script
Goal	Interview Questions


Understand commute patterns	


1.Can you describe your daily commute (duration, mode, frequency)?


	2. How does commuting affect your morning/evening routine?
Explore emotional impact	3. How do you feel about your commute?


	4. What do you lose or sacrifice because of commuting (sleep, family time, hobbies, mental health)?
Explore fairness & control
5. Do you feel your commute is fair compared to others? Why or why not?


	6. How much control or choice do you feel you have over your commute?
Understand role of remote work

7. Does your job allow remote or hybrid work? Would you prefer it?


	8. If you could eliminate or reduce your commute, how would it change your life?
Explore value of time

	9. If you had an extra hour daily (reduced commute), how would you use it?
Quality-of-life connection

	10. Do you think commute time is a good indicator of quality of life? Why or why not?
Reflection & policy ideas

	11. What should policymakers or employers change about commuting or work flexibility?

User Research: Findings
Interviewees (Broad Descriptions – No PII)
ID	Profile	Commute Characteristics
P1	Teacher, 40s, mother of two	65 min, bus + car, 5 days/week
P2	Data Analyst, late 20s, tech worker	Mostly remote, occasional 15-min car commute
P3	Nurse, 30s, healthcare worker	70 min, public transit only
P4 (optional)	Construction worker, mid-50s	75 min, carpool, inflexible schedule

Key Insights & Quotes
Theme	Findings	Real Quotes
Commute as lost time	Commute described as “stolen time” — not just minutes, but lost family time, rest, energy.	“My job doesn’t drain me — my commute does.”
Emotional fatigue	Commuters report stress, exhaustion, and reduced patience at work and home.	“By the time I get home, I’ve already spent my energy before even walking in.”
Time equity	Remote workers gain time autonomy, not just convenience.	“Remote work didn’t just make me productive — it made me human again.”
Lack of control	Nurses, teachers, and construction workers cannot avoid commuting even when it harms well-being.	“We don’t commute because we enjoy it — we commute because we have to.”
Industry-based inequality	Workers in healthcare, construction, education have less remote flexibility than tech or management roles.	“Some people get to choose their commute. I don’t.”
Extra hour use	Most would use regained time for sleep, family, hobbies, or physical/mental well-being.	“I would finally sleep enough to stop feeling tired all the time.”

Planned Improvements for Part III
Research Finding	Change to Storytelling & Design
Commute impacts emotions, energy, and family well-being	Add emotional interviews and quotes as callout boxes or audio overlays in Shorthand
Remote work redefines time equity	Add metric: Hours regained per year by remote workers
Industry determines commute burden	Include visuals using ACS S0802/S0804 to show inequities in transit reliance and remote eligibility
Control > commute duration	Introduce concept: “Time Autonomy” vs “Time Cost”
Commute is a form of inequality	Add persona cards: Teacher, Nurse, Remote tech analyst, Construction worker
Commute = “invisible tax on life”	Update final takeaway: “Commute time is lifetime — and some groups lose far more of it.”

Final Reflection
This research showed that commute time isn't just a transportation issue — it's a time equity, emotional well-being, and opportunity issue.
The most powerful stories weren't about minutes — but about lost mornings, exhaustion, missed family time, and lack of control.
These insights will help me shift my story from “commute duration differences” to “commute burden and time inequality.”
