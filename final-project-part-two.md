# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  

Audience Group	Why It Matters
Local policymakers	Identify inequitable commute burdens and design better transit, zoning, or housing policies
Transportation planners	Understand worker types most negatively affected by distance, mode, or lack of options
Employers designing remote/hybrid policies	See how commute time influences well-being, retention, and time equity
Community members/workers	Recognize how commute time affects energy, family time, and life satisfaction

Interview Script
Goal	Interview Questions


Understand commute patterns	


	1. When you saw the opening storyboard (Sketch 1), what message did you take away?

Answer:
It clearly showed that Allegheny County has shorter average commutes, but I didn’t fully understand why that might still hide deeper inequalities. It set the stage but didn't make the problem feel urgent yet.

2. Did the transition from average commute to long-commuter burden (Sketch 2) feel clear and logical?

Answer:
Yes, it made sense that the average hides the extreme cases. Seeing the 60+ minute commuters helped me understand the “hidden time tax,” but I’d like more visual emphasis on time lost in hours, not just percentages.

3. Which visual or quote made you feel something, not just understand the data?

Answer:
The quote “I don’t lose minutes, I lose moments” was powerful. But some visuals still felt too statistical—there weren’t enough emotional cues like faces, context, or real human situations.

4. Do any sketches clearly show what people sacrifice because of commuting—like sleep, family time, or health?

Answer:
You showed time lost, but not really what people actually lose because of it. A visual showing ‘what that time could have been used for’ would make it more relatable.

5. In the gender, industry, and occupation charts, did it feel clear who loses more time unfairly?

Answer:
I understood that teachers, nurses, and construction workers commute more, but I didn’t fully grasp the fairness issue. Maybe include why these groups have less choice, not just longer commutes.

6. Do any visuals help you see who commutes by choice vs. who commutes because they have no choice?

Answer:
Not clearly yet. The data shows who has longer commutes but doesn't show who has control. A “Commute Choice vs. Commute Obligation” visual would help.

7. Does the remote work sketch help convey that some jobs structurally avoid commute burden?

Answer:
Yes, but it feels more like a work-from-home statistic, not a statement about privilege or inequality. It should feel more like a contrast between freedom and constraint.

8. Can you imagine how life would change for these commuters if their commute was reduced or removed?

Answer:
Not fully. I understood the time impact, but I didn’t emotionally feel the gain. Show lifestyle impact—like more sleep, family breakfast, health—rather than just hours saved.

9. Does any part of the storyboard show how people would actually use an extra hour?

Answer:
Not yet. A pie chart or icons showing “sleep, exercise, family time, mental rest” would help bring that to life visually.

10. After seeing these sketches, do you believe commute time can be a quality-of-life indicator?

Answer:
Yes, but only after seeing the occupation and remote work visuals. That’s where it became clear that commute is more than just travel—it’s about time, choice, and mental well-being.

11. Did the final storyboard make the issue feel serious enough for policymakers or employers to act on?

Answer:
It was persuasive, but I wanted clearer visual “so what?” insights—like specific groups that are being left behind and what policies could help them.

User Research: Findings
Interviewees (Broad Descriptions – No PII)
ID	Profile	Commute Characteristics
P1	Teacher, 40s, mother of two	65 min, bus + car, 5 days/week
P2	Data Analyst, late 20s, tech worker	Mostly remote, occasional 15-min car commute
P3	Nurse, 30s, healthcare worker	70 min, public transit only
P4 (optional)	Construction worker, mid-50s	75 min, carpool, inflexible schedule

Key Insights & Quotes
Theme	Findings	Real Quotes
Commute as lost time	Commute described as “stolen time” — not just minutes, but lost family time, rest, energy.	“My job doesn’t drain me — my commute does.”
Emotional fatigue	Commuters report stress, exhaustion, and reduced patience at work and home.	“By the time I get home, I’ve already spent my energy before even walking in.”
Time equity	Remote workers gain time autonomy, not just convenience.	“Remote work didn’t just make me productive — it made me human again.”
Lack of control	Nurses, teachers, and construction workers cannot avoid commuting even when it harms well-being.	“We don’t commute because we enjoy it — we commute because we have to.”
Industry-based inequality	Workers in healthcare, construction, education have less remote flexibility than tech or management roles.	“Some people get to choose their commute. I don’t.”
Extra hour use	Most would use regained time for sleep, family, hobbies, or physical/mental well-being.	“I would finally sleep enough to stop feeling tired all the time.”

Planned Improvements for Part III
Research Finding	Change to Storytelling & Design
Commute impacts emotions, energy, and family well-being	Add emotional interviews and quotes as callout boxes or audio overlays in Shorthand
Remote work redefines time equity	Add metric: Hours regained per year by remote workers
Industry determines commute burden	Include visuals using ACS S0802/S0804 to show inequities in transit reliance and remote eligibility
Control > commute duration	Introduce concept: “Time Autonomy” vs “Time Cost”
Commute is a form of inequality	Add persona cards: Teacher, Nurse, Remote tech analyst, Construction worker
Commute = “invisible tax on life”	Update final takeaway: “Commute time is lifetime — and some groups lose far more of it.”

Final Reflection
This research showed that commute time isn't just a transportation issue — it's a time equity, emotional well-being, and opportunity issue.
The most powerful stories weren't about minutes — but about lost mornings, exhaustion, missed family time, and lack of control.
These insights will help me shift my story from “commute duration differences” to “commute burden and time inequality.”
