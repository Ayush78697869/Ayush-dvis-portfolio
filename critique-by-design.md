## Step two: My Critique
Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here.  What stood out to you?  What did you find worked really well?  What didn't work well? 
This visualization provides a clear overview of the world’s biggest military spenders in 2021. The use of a circular (or pie-style) layout effectively emphasizes the U.S. and China’s dominance in global defence spending. What stood out most is how visually large the U.S. segment is compared to all others. The design also uses military-themed colours (greens and khakis) and toy soldier imagery, which fits the topic well and adds a strong visual identity. What worked really well: Visual hierarchy: The U.S. and China’s portions immediately draw attention, accurately showing their disproportionate spending. Design consistency: The typography, colours, and military imagery create a cohesive theme. Annotations: The small fact boxes about each country (e.g., “China’s spending has increased 27 years in a row”) adds meaningful context. What didn’t work as well: Readability issues: The green-on-green text makes it harder to read, especially for smaller labels like percentages and country names. Proportional distortion: The circular chart with different shape pies is visually appealing but can make it difficult to precisely compare smaller spenders (e.g., Germany vs. France). Data focus: The “Rest of the World” category is huge but visually underexplained — it could benefit from more context or a breakdown.

Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?
The primary audience seems to be general readers interested in global economics, defence, or policy trends, as well as students or professionals seeking a quick visual summary. The visualization is effective for this group because it simplifies complex global data into an immediately understandable picture. It’s not overloaded with statistics, and the design grabs attention in a social-media-friendly way . However, for policy analysts or researchers, it might feel too high-level. They might want more granular data, such as year-over-year change or regional distribution. The answer to this question therefore is really who the target audience is.

Based on your critique, what do you think you'll try to focus on in your redesign?   Any ideas or inspiration for how you can make a better data visualization?  What are you excited to try next? *
I switched to a bar graph which is more coherent and added the necessary information not communicated through the graph itself as a footnote much like the pie graph.

## Step four: Test the solution

Step 4: Critique from interview
Q: Can you tell me what you think this is?
It looks like a chart showing how much different countries spend on their military. But since every bar is the same colour, it’s a little hard to tell things apart.

Q: Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
The U.S. spends the most, and the “Rest of the World” group is also really big. The other countries spend much less, but they all blend together because the bars look the same.

Q: Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Yeah  the “Rest of the World” bar is huge and kind of takes over the whole chart. Since it’s the same colour as the other bars, I wasn’t sure at first if it was a country or something else.

Q: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Probably students or anyone trying to understand global military spending. But the chart design doesn’t make it super easy to compare the smaller countries.

Q: Is there anything you would change or do differently?
I’d use different colours so it’s easier to compare countries. Specially for the rest of the world.

Interview 2:
Q: Can you tell me what you think this is?
It looks like a chart about military spending. Everything is the same colour so it’s a bit hard to tell the countries apart.

Q: Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
The U.S. and China almost spend equivalent to the Rest of the World. 

Q: Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
The colour choice of writing green on green makes it difficult to read.

Q: Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Probably people who want a simple breakdown of spending, like students or readers learning about defence budgets.

Q: Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Colour shading should be different and Rest of the world should be separated from all countries.



## Step five: build the solution

I decided to change the colour scheme to gradient and move rest of the world to the bottom in grey colour
