# 🚗 Commute Time as a Proxy Indicator of Quality of Life  
### *Who Loses the Most Time — and Why — in Allegheny County?*

---

## 📘 Project Overview

Commute time is more than just a transportation statistic — it is time **taken from life**. Every minute spent traveling to work is time **not spent resting, caring for family, or pursuing personal goals**.  

This project uses **2024 ACS 1-Year Estimates** to explore commute patterns across:
- 📍 U.S. vs. Pennsylvania vs. Allegheny County  
- 👤 Gender  
- 🏭 Industry  
- 💼 Occupation  
- 🏡 Remote vs. In-Person Workers  

Even though Allegheny County has **shorter average commute times**, averages can be misleading. This project uncovers **hidden commute burdens** affecting certain workers — revealing that *commute time is not shared equally*.

---

## 🎯 One-Sentence Story
> **Commute time is lifetime — and some groups lose far more of it.**

---

## 👥 Target Audience

| Stakeholder | Why It Matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| Policy Makers | Transit equity, housing planning |
| Employers | Remote work strategy, time equity |
| Urban Planners | Commute burden hotspots |
| Community Members | Quality of life insights |

---

## 🧑‍💼 User Story Framework

| User Group | What They Want to Learn | Data Table |
|------------|-------------------------|------------|
| Long Commuters (60+ min) | Is my commute burden unusually high? | ACS S0801 |
| Female Professionals | Do women lose more time commuting? | ACS S0801 |
| Remote Workers | How much time do I save without commuting? | ACS S0801 |
| Transit-Dependent Workers | Does my job force a longer commute? | ACS S0802 |
| Service/Construction Workers | Why is remote work not an option for me? | ACS S0804 |

## 📖 Story Structure

### 1️⃣ Beginning — Setting the Context  
**Sketch 1: Baseline Mean Travel Time by Geography**  
*(Bar chart: U.S. vs PA vs Allegheny County)*  
<img width="550" height="700" alt="image" src="Picture 1.png" />

> Allegheny County has the shortest average commute — but does this hide deeper inequalities?

---

### 2️⃣ Middle — Who Loses the Most?

#### 🚦 User Story 1 — Long Commuters  
**Sketch 2: Commute Time Distribution (Allegheny County)**  
*(Histogram showing 60+ minute commuters)*  
![Sketch2]()

> The top 10% of workers lose **over 250 hours per year** just traveling.

---

#### 👩‍🚌 User Story 2 — Gender Commute Gap  
**Sketch 3: Mean Travel Time by Sex & Geography**  
*(Grouped bar chart)*  
![Sketch3]()

> Women in Allegheny County lose **more commute time than men**, despite similar job locations.

---

#### 🏡 User Story 3 — Remote Workers  
**Sketch 4: % Worked from Home Across Geographies**  
*(Comparative bar chart)*  
![Sketch4]()

> Remote workers regain **hundreds of hours per year** — representing the **highest quality-of-life score**.

---

### 🔍 Explaining the Inequality

#### 🏭 Industry-Based Burden  
**Sketch 5: Public Transit Dependency by Industry**  
*(Horizontal bar / Heatmap)*  
![Sketch5]()

> Industries like **Education & Healthcare** have the highest public transit reliance — leading to longer, less flexible commutes.

---

#### 💼 Occupation-Based Flexibility  
**Sketch 6: Work-From-Home Eligibility by Occupation** *(Lollipop Chart)*  
![Sketch6]()

> Management and Tech jobs have **96% access to WFH**, while Service and Construction have almost **none** — locking them into commute-dependent lifestyles.

## 🛠 Policy and Design Implications

### High-Impact Recommendations for Allegheny County

| Focus Area | Policy Idea |
|------------|-------------|
| Transit Equity | Improve reliability in high-dependency corridors |
| Commute Flexibility | Incentivize hybrid/WFH beyond management roles |
| Housing-Labor Alignment | Promote housing near job clusters and transit |

---

### 💡 Final Takeaway

> **“To improve quality of life, we don't just build parks—  
we give people back the hour they lose sitting in traffic.”**
