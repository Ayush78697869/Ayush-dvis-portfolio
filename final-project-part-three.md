# Changes made since Part II
> I replaced my original title “Who Loses Time — and Why — in Allegheny County?”  with the framing “Commute Time as a Proxy Indicator of Quality of Life” based on recommendation. This version immediately communicates the central question of my story and better draws the reader in.

2)I strengthened the connection between each visualization and the overall narrative. Instead of showing charts “on their own,” I added one-sentence insights and implications beneath every sketch.

3)For example, after the gender commute gap chart, I added: "Men in Allegheny County lose more commute time than women, despite similar job locations.So while the gap is not solely due to “men working farther from home than women,” structural and social-behavioral factors tend to skew commutes longer for men"

4)I added a concise CTA section that tells each audience segment (policy makers, employers, planners, and community members) exactly what they should do with the information.

5)I updated the wireframe so it clearly communicates how my sketches move from context → inequality → explanation → action.

6)I modified Sketch 3 (the gender gap chart) to include a higher-contrast highlight color, as suggested, so the small differences are visually clearer.


## The audience
>  Interview 1 — Transportation Advocacy Group Representative

Q: When you look at commute-time differences by gender and industry, what information is most useful for advocacy work?
A: “We need clear evidence of who is being left behind. If you can highlight which groups consistently lose more time, it strengthens our push for equitable transit investment.”

 Interview 2 — Employer (HR Manager)

Q: Would commute-time data influence workplace flexibility or hybrid scheduling?
A: “Absolutely. If I knew which employees lose the most time commuting, I would push for flexible hours or hybrid work. Commute burden is directly tied to retention.”

 Interview 3 — Urban Planner

Q: What would make commute inequality data more actionable for urban planning?
A: “Focus on transit-dependent industries. Healthcare, education — those are where the longest, least flexible commutes happen. If you highlight those clearly, planners know where to intervene.”

 Interview 4 — Long Commuter (60+ minutes)

Q: How does your long commute affect your daily life?
A: “I lose two hours every day. By the time I get home, the evening is gone. It affects my energy, my social life, everything.”

 Interview 5 — Female Professional

Q: Do commute times influence your job choices or work schedule?
A: “Yes. I balance most household tasks, so a long commute just isn’t possible. I’ve turned down higher-paying jobs because they’d add an hour to my day.”

 Interview 6 — Service Worker (Transit Dependent)

Q: What is the biggest challenge with your commute?
A: “Unpredictability. If the bus is late, I lose money. My shifts depend on being on time, but transit doesn’t always cooperate.”

 Interview 7 — Healthcare Worker

Q: Why do you rely on public transit instead of driving?
A: “Parking near the hospital is expensive and limited. Transit is my only option, but it takes a long time and often involves multiple transfers.”

 Interview 8 — Remote/Hybrid Worker

Q: How has remote or hybrid work affected your quality of life?
A: “It gave me back entire days. Even working from home twice a week saves me six to eight hours. That’s huge for my mental health.”

# Final thoughts
> What the Data Shows

Long commutes are concentrated. The top 10% of workers lose over 250 hours per year, meaning the burden isn’t widespread — it’s carried by a small group.

Gender differences persist. Men lose more commute time than women even with similar job locations, suggesting differences in job type, flexibility, and household roles.

Remote work is the biggest time-saver. Workers with WFH access regain the most hours, but access is unequal: tech and management roles benefit; service and construction do not.

Industry drives commute pain. Healthcare and education workers rely heavily on transit, making their commutes longer and less predictable.

What This Implies

Commute time is really about time equity.
Some people regain time because their jobs allow flexibility; others lose it simply due to the industry they work in or the mode of transportation available to them.

What I Suggest

Target transit improvements in healthcare and education corridors where commute burden is highest.

Expand flexibility: employers should consider hybrid or staggered schedules where possible.

Align housing and job centers to reduce distance-based inequalities.

Encourage community advocacy around transit reliability and workplace flexibility.

Final Takeaway

Commute time is lifetime. Improving equity means giving people back the hours they lose — not just improving the roads they travel on.
