## ðŸ“Œ About Me

Hi! I'm **Ayush Mishra** (he/him).  
I am a graduate student in the **Master of Information Systems Management (MISM)** program at Carnegie Mellon University.

I have a background in software engineering and product management, and I enjoy working with data to build meaningful solutions. Iâ€™m passionate about technology, analytics, and building user-centric products.

Outside of academics, I enjoy fitness, music, and working on technical side-projects.

## ðŸŽ¯ What I Hope to Learn

Through this course, I aim to:

- Communicate insights clearly using data
- Build compelling, persuasive visual stories
- Strengthen visualization design & critique skills
- Use tools like Tableau, Flourish, RAWGraphs, and others to create interactive visualizations

I want to use data storytelling in product and business contexts to drive decision-making.
